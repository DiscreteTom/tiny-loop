Check if modified code duplicates existing code in other files.

Steps:
1. Read focused files to understand the modified logic
2. Search for similar code patterns in other files
3. Report violations if substantial duplication is found

Violation criteria - Report if:
- Business logic duplicated across files (>30 lines of similar code)
- Complex algorithms or calculations repeated identically
- Data transformation logic that's the same in multiple places
- Functions that could be extracted into shared utilities

Exemptions - Do NOT report:
- Trivial code (one-liners, common patterns like error handling)
- Test code and test utilities
- Similar but contextually different logic (e.g., different validation rules)
- Common patterns (builder methods, getters/setters)
- Standard boilerplate (CLI parsing, config loading)
- Factory methods or templates with intentional configuration duplication

Check for unexplained numeric literals in diff.

Steps:

2. Check if numbers have explanatory comments or clear context
3. Report violations for unexplained numbers

Violation criteria - Report if:
- Business logic constants without explanation (thresholds, multipliers, limits)
- Arbitrary timeouts or delays without context
- Numeric configuration values hardcoded in logic without comments
- Calculation constants without explanation

Exemptions - Do NOT report:
- 0, 1, -1 in common contexts (indexing, loops, exit codes, boolean-like)
- Numbers in test files
- Numbers in configuration files
- Numbers with nearby comments (within 3 lines above or inline)
